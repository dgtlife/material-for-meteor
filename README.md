# Material for Meteor
Material for Meteor (MFM) is a [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) package that implements Google's [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) in Blaze. Users of this package can call familiar Meteor templates with parameters in order to render Material Design components, i.e. elements or groups of elements that conform, in appearance and behavior, to the Material Design specification. There may also be components and behaviors not prescribed by Material Design.
## Demo Site
Demos of the available components and documentation for their use can be found at [Material for Meteor](http://mfm.dgtlife.com/). The MFM site is built using this package, and is as such a living example of how to use the package. The code for the website can be reviewed at this [repo](https://github.com/dgtlife/material-for-meteor-website). This site is hosted on a free Heroku dyno (that sleeps after 30 mins of inactivity), so the site may be slow to load when the dyno is asleep.
## Components
The set of components is initially based on the author's needs. However, over time, and if other contributors come forward to scratch their own itch, the set of components will grow according to what is actually needed by the community.
## Usage
This package is currently a 'work-in-progress' and as such is not recommended for wide public consumption in production apps. However, those willing to evaluate the package are welcome to do so with the understanding that there will be little to no support via the issue queue. Those advanced users who are comfortable with a package at this stage of its life cycle can use it, at their own risk, in any mode that they choose.
## ToDo
* Complete documentation of the package on the MFM website.
